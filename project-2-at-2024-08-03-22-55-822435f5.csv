However, there were no effects of pretreatment on impairments to attention span. Our findings reinforce several aspects of the validity of the MK-801-induced model of social withdrawal and hyperactivity and also support the use of this novel set-up for further investigations to assess the antipsychotic potential of novel compounds.'","","",458000,"Animal studies show improved social behaviour and reduced hyperactivity, but no effect on attention span.

Cannabis effects were independent of any alcohol effects. A review of studies found that early-onset cannabis use (i.e. before age 16-18) is associated with worse cognitive consequences than adult cannabis use, including poorer attention & visual search, and reduced IQ & executive function. A Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) study found that one month of abstaining from cannabis use resulted in measurable improvement in memory functions important for learning among adolescents and young adults who are regular cannabis users.","https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18020202; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871602003344","",982000,"Use during teenage years appears to affect important cognitive functions.
